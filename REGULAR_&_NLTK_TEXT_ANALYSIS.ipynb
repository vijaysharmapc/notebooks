Daily Bread Food Bank\"\"Hi, could anyone please advise what to do when your \\r\\nFreshbooks mobile app freezes just as you create a new estimate or invoice? I use a relatively new Android device and I update my Freshbooks app whenever a new version is released on the Play Store. I am usually required to kill the app because no amount of waiting seems to fix it. When I reopen my app and I go and search for the last invoice that I created, then it doesn't show the last entry i was working on prior to the freeze. But when I create a new invoice for that client, then the entry suddenly appears again which means I have a duplicate. This is happening more and more often these days.\"'Want to make a difference this season?

I love your product but am frankly pissed off that this change has not been implemented, because it is a constant waste of my time and I'm sure a lot of other users. Here's the problem. I have over 800 invoices in freshbooks from the past 2 years, when I get desk time to go into invoices & prep my invoices I will often work on many drafts at a time. I go into invoicing and want to only work on drafts, so I set a filter to see just my drafts, it brings back however many invoices that are drafts. I then select and invoice, work on it, save it and when it returns back to invoices after saving, it shows all the invoices again. I want to be able to set a filter and have it stay set until I choose to unset it. This is a royal pain in the ass and time waster to have to constantly go back into the filter when working with lots of drafts in one sitting and there are hundreds of other invoices to be filtered out, it also slows down the switching between pages, because more invoices have to load as well. Basically, please, please address this so you can set a filter and keep it set. I have called in several times and requested this feature. This would be a simple but wonderful improvement. Also one other issue I'd like to bring to light as well. If you open invoices or any other area where you click to sort by name, it sorts from Z to A instead of A to Z. Also annoying because you have to click the name header twice to get it to sort from A to Z. This is simple stuff that will really improve your product experience for the user.

YOU WITH A GREAT BOOK!  http://www.amazon.com/dp/1507826478/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_3Qh9ub0DDH7JN \\r\\nThe CBS Evening News with Gregg Preston: Twenty-five years ago, the communist leaders sent in tanks to put an end to weeks of peaceful protests in Tiananmen Square. Today, people from all over the world queued to buy flowers honoring the dead on the square... This evening there were also many blind or partially sighted teenagers. Perhaps they deliberately gathered to support the today\\'s protest of the students, on the occasion of the anniversary. In previous weeks, the authorities had been able to prevent a few similar peaceful gatherings in the square, but today they decided not to interfere. The evening was pleasant and crowded, though the breeze had totally subsided. There were vendors selling kites and people trying to put their kites in the air. Strange, huh? Well, there are many things that are allowed now... But if you are concerned about discussing the history of the square this is something else. You should never talk about the history of the square from 1989. That dark and violent history, you know. Anyway, we were tempted by a pair of Chinese teenagers, a boy and a girl, who was kissing. They were locked their lips passionate without shame in the middle of the square. And guess what? They were true romantics. The boy named Chao was clutching a kite. He handed the kite on the girl. The girl, named Hua (flower) pulled out a pen and wrote her name and the name of the boy onto the kite. \\r\\n\"Go Chao, go. Let us fly the kite high up in the sky,\" Hua called out. Can you imagine that the Lord God was watching and He sent a wind that lifted the kite high in the air? Of course the job was supported also by the skills of Chao, but it was a real miracle. Suddenly the boy stopped and looked down. The kite had risen to too high an angle for the wind to sustain, but Chao did not paid attention to it any more. A step ahead of the boy on the ground stood a brand new box with four razor blades. Amazed, Chao stood looking upon the Gillette blades with his gleaming eyes. Hua could not understand why Chao had suddenly stopped. But even from a distance she saw that the boy dropped the rope of the kite and stooped to pick something off the ground. \\r\\nIn the new millennium, the UN Security Council decided that some of the Middle East countries have to halt all activities related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. The threat of a THIRD WORLD WAR conquered the minds of the world community. The focus fell on the Arab world and the terrorist Islamic radicals. Nobody could imagine that the real threat would come from elsewhere. At that time, one day, someone close to the Feliciano clan, the most notorious and feared group within the Camorra mafia, deliberately left a brand new box with four razor blades in the middle of a lively square somewhere in Central Asia. Inside this seemingly brand new and unopened product, on the edge of one of the blades lurked a deadly virus. A virus synthesized by Dr. Kirsch, which was harmless to the majority of mankind, but instantly lethal to the Mongoloid race. In two years only the contagion spread around the world and killed more than three billion Koreans, Japanese and Chinese people before the invention of the cure. In the most affected countries as China nearly two million volunteers were mobilized to test the infected people every day, prompting government institutions to declare an extensive area under quarantine with highly restricted access. The closure of borders and the lack of manpower dealt a heavy blow to the global economy. The most essential goods, domestic appliances and thousands of other tools suddenly disappeared. It was difficult to buy even a toaster. Bozhidar Gospodinov, copyright © 2015.

Put the mileage in as the dollar amount and pull the \"mileage\" category to get total miles to do an external calculation, but doing so throws off the total summary expense amounts inside Freshbooks expenses.\\r\\n2. Put mileage in as a note (per your help section) but this requires a manual cut/paste and/or an external calculation to tally it all up if I want the dollar amount for that line item to match. However, I\\'m using Freshbooks to eliminate just this sort of additional calculation.\\r\\n3. Use an external mileage tracker and keep it out of Freshbooks entirely, but, again, I\\'m using Freshbooks to eliminate this sort of thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be a great option to allow users to enter either mileage or discrete gas costs for that category or offer two different categories. Then allow those using actual miles driven to set a per mile rate for calculating the cost of each mileage line item automatically.\\r\\n\\r\\nAny chance this is in the dev pipeline?'\"I just discovered FreshBooks today and I'm loving it.

I specifically will not support your product just because of that song. You call yourself \"fresh?\" Then freshen up that damn jingle!\\r\\n\\r\\nNo offense to you people personally or professionally, of course. You may be fabulous. Who knows? But as long as that commercial exists, I don\\'t care. I think it\\'s the single worst jingle I\\'ve ever heard in my 37 years. Are you branding yourself? Yes, and that\\'s a good thing. But, your effective branding is backfiring for at least this one guy. And you know that if one guy feels this way, others do too. I\\'m just the one who\\'s willing to be vocal about it. How many others are you turning off who do not say a word about it? They never give you a chance to demonstrate how great your product is. More than one company has fallen because of poor marketing. After all, it\\'s never the steak. It\\'s always the sizzle. The value people place on a product has very little to do with the product itself, and everything to do with that the people believe of the product. And when you start off on the wrong foot, you have almost no possibility of recovering.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou should know that this was inspired by that jingle driving me nuts. I listen to CNBC on Sirius in the morning when I\\'m getting ready for work, and your commercial always comes on when I\\'m in the shower and cannot turn off the radio.

[and I can't figure out why few others do so.] Thanks Anton!\"'cool new site'\"Some things I really like about fresh books but your lack of being able to generate a receipt is ridiculous. I get a receipt every time I go shopping, so why can't a leading online payment system be able to provide a receipt? \\r\\nRetailers do not give me an invoice, then mark it as paid. \\r\\nI have an online payment gateway and would like my customers to receive a nice looking receipt with my logo on it without me having to generate an invoice for them. Surely you guys can build an function where we can adapt this into our websites easily.\\r\\nCrappy Paypal generic receipts do not cut it.\"'New at FreshBooks: FreshBooks now has an Add-on store!!
