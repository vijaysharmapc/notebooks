## What is this?

At EQ Works, we take a more effective path to technical interview -- you get to work on some problems based on one or more work samples that resemble our actual technical stack. If you are a real maker, you will find the problems way easier (maybe more enjoyable) than algorithm questions like "how to implement bubble sort?", yet much more meaningful for us to understand how well you can integrate into our team from a technical perspective.

If you are interested to work with us, but haven't already applied, go to https://eqworks.workable.com/ and apply for *only one* primary role that you're interested in.

You will then receive an email containing problems which you may solve using one of the work samples in this repository.

## Roles

### Data

You will solve problems using the [`data-mr`](data-mr) work sample. The work sample resembles our data processing and analytics setup. [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) is our choice to implement map reduce and machine learning jobs.

### Pipeline

You will solve problems using the [`backend-go`](backend-go/src/counter) work sample. The work sample resembles our backend setup. [Golang](https://golang.org/) is our choice to implement performance critical services and applications.

### Product

You will receive problems that cover both server-side and client-side aspects. You have the choice to do both or focus on one.

For the *server-side* aspect, you will solve problems using one of [`api-python`](api-python) or [`api-node`](api-node) work samples.

For the *client-side* aspect, you can either leverage one of the `api-*` work samples, or you may consume a [hosted version](https://eq-work-samples-api.herokuapp.com) on Heroku (uses `api-python`). Either way, you will need to explore one of the `api-*` work samples for API endpoint details (as no API documentation will be given). You are strongly recommended to clone and run your own copy of the API, as that allows the maximum flexibility for your solutions (for example, you can modify the API endpoints to suit your client-side implementation needs).
